# Tiling-WMs
A repo to keep and maintain personal config files for various tiling window managers.

Over the past couple years I have "WM hopped" quite a bit and always seem to return to the i3wm

My tendency to "WM hop" is the reason I titled this repo WMs and not specific to i3.

Currently I am using i3 on all my Arch installs and the reason why there are only i3 related configs here

Enjoy!
